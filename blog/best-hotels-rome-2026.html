        <p>Rome is one of the most visited cities in the world, and for good reason. The Eternal City offers an unparalleled blend of ancient history, world-class art, and some of the best food on the planet. But with thousands of hotels to choose from, finding the right place to stay can be overwhelming.</p>

        <p>We've put together this comprehensive guide to help you find the perfect hotel in Rome, whether you're traveling on a tight budget or looking for the ultimate luxury experience.</p>

        <h2>Where to Stay in Rome: Best Neighborhoods</h2>

        <p>Before diving into specific hotels, it helps to understand Rome's main neighborhoods for tourists:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Centro Storico</strong> — The historic heart of Rome, walking distance to the Pantheon, Piazza Navona, and Trevi Fountain. Most convenient but priciest location.</li>
            <li><strong>Trastevere</strong> — Charming cobblestone streets, excellent restaurants, and a lively nightlife scene. Great for travelers who want an authentic Roman experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Monti</strong> — Rome's oldest neighborhood, now a trendy area with vintage shops, wine bars, and a village-like atmosphere near the Colosseum.</li>
            <li><strong>Testaccio</strong> — A local favorite, known for its food market, traditional Roman cuisine, and fewer tourists. Excellent value for money.</li>
            <li><strong>Prati</strong> — Near the Vatican, this elegant residential area offers upscale hotels and easy access to St. Peter's Basilica.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Luxury Hotels ($300+ per night)</h2>

        <p>For travelers seeking the finest experience Rome has to offer, these luxury hotels deliver impeccable service, stunning locations, and unforgettable ambiance.</p>

        <h3>Hotel de Russie — Piazza del Popolo</h3>
        <p>Nestled between Piazza del Popolo and the Spanish Steps, Hotel de Russie is a favorite among discerning travelers. The secret garden and terraced restaurant are highlights, offering a peaceful retreat from the bustling streets. Rooms start around $450 per night in peak season, but the central location and Rocco Forte service make it worth every euro.</p>

        <h3>Hotel Eden — Via Ludovisi</h3>
        <p>Recently renovated, Hotel Eden boasts one of the best rooftop restaurants in Rome with panoramic views over the city. The interiors blend classic elegance with modern comfort. Expect to pay $400-$700 per night depending on the season.</p>

        <h2>Mid-Range Hotels ($120-$300 per night)</h2>

        <p>You don't need to spend a fortune to enjoy a comfortable and well-located stay in Rome. These mid-range options offer excellent value.</p>

        <h3>Hotel Raphael — Largo Febo</h3>
        <p>Just steps from Piazza Navona, Hotel Raphael features an ivy-covered facade and a rooftop terrace with breathtaking views of Rome's skyline. Rooms are elegantly decorated, and the location is unbeatable for sightseeing. Rates typically range from $180-$300 per night.</p>

        <h3>Chapter Roma — San Lorenzo</h3>
        <p>A stylish boutique hotel in the vibrant San Lorenzo neighborhood, Chapter Roma combines contemporary design with warm hospitality. The rooftop pool is a huge plus during Roman summers. Rooms start around $150 per night.</p>

        <h3>Hotel Santa Maria — Trastevere</h3>
        <p>Set in a former 16th-century cloister, this charming hotel in the heart of Trastevere offers rooms opening onto a beautiful orange tree courtyard. It's one of the best-value stays in a prime location, with rates from $120-$200 per night.</p>

        <h2>Budget-Friendly Hotels (Under $120 per night)</h2>

        <p>Rome can absolutely be done on a budget. These affordable hotels prove that you don't need to sacrifice comfort or location.</p>

        <h3>Hotel Lancelot — Near the Colosseum</h3>
        <p>A family-run gem just a 5-minute walk from the Colosseum. The Lancelot has been welcoming guests for decades and is known for its friendly staff and home-like atmosphere. Rates start from $90 per night, which is remarkable for the location.</p>

        <h3>Hotel Artorius — Monti</h3>
        <p>A clean, modern budget hotel in the trendy Monti neighborhood. Rooms are small but well-designed, and you're steps away from excellent restaurants and the Colosseum. Expect to pay $70-$110 per night.</p>

        <h2>Tips for Booking Hotels in Rome</h2>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Book early for peak season</strong> — April to June and September to October are the busiest months. Book at least 2-3 months in advance for the best rates.</li>
            <li><strong>Consider shoulder season</strong> — November, early March, and late January offer significantly lower prices and fewer crowds.</li>
            <li><strong>Check the city tax</strong> — Rome charges a tourist tax of $3-7 per person per night depending on the hotel category. This is usually not included in the booking price.</li>
            <li><strong>Look for breakfast included</strong> — Many Roman hotels include a generous Italian breakfast. This can save you $10-15 per person daily.</li>
            <li><strong>Use comparison platforms</strong> — Always compare prices across multiple booking platforms to find the best deal.</li>
        </ol>
