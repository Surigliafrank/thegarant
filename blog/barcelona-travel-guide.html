        <p>Barcelona is one of those rare cities that has it all — stunning architecture, golden beaches, world-class cuisine, and a cultural scene that never sleeps. Whether you're visiting for a long weekend or a full week, this guide covers everything you need to make the most of your Barcelona trip.</p>

        <h2>Getting Around Barcelona</h2>

        <p>Barcelona has an excellent public transport system. The metro covers most tourist areas and runs from 5:00 AM to midnight (24 hours on Saturdays). A T-Casual card gives you 10 rides for about $12, which is the most economical option.</p>

        <p>That said, Barcelona is a very walkable city. Most of the main attractions in the Gothic Quarter, Born, and Eixample neighborhoods are within walking distance of each other. For the beaches and Montjuic, the metro is your best bet.</p>

        <h2>Must-See Attractions</h2>

        <h3>La Sagrada Familia</h3>
        <p>Gaudi's unfinished masterpiece is Barcelona's most iconic landmark. The basilica has been under construction since 1882, with completion now expected around 2026. Book tickets online at least two weeks in advance — this is non-negotiable, as it regularly sells out. The best time to visit is early morning when the light streaming through the stained glass windows creates a magical atmosphere.</p>

        <h3>Park Guell</h3>
        <p>Another Gaudi gem, this hilltop park offers colorful mosaic-covered structures and panoramic views of the city and sea. The monumental zone requires a timed ticket (about $10), but the free areas of the park are equally beautiful for a morning stroll.</p>

        <h3>Gothic Quarter (Barri Gotic)</h3>
        <p>Lose yourself in the narrow medieval streets of the Gothic Quarter. The Barcelona Cathedral, Placa Reial, and countless hidden squares make this neighborhood perfect for aimless exploration. Visit in the morning or evening to avoid the midday crowds.</p>

        <h3>La Boqueria Market</h3>
        <p>One of the world's most famous food markets, La Boqueria on Las Ramblas is a feast for the senses. Skip the tourist-trap fruit stalls at the entrance and head deeper inside for better prices and more authentic vendors. Try the fresh seafood bars at the back of the market for an incredible lunch.</p>

        <h3>Montjuic</h3>
        <p>Take the cable car up to Montjuic hill for beautiful gardens, the Joan Miro Foundation, and spectacular views of the harbor. On summer evenings, the Magic Fountain puts on a free water and light show that's well worth seeing.</p>

        <h2>Where to Eat: A Food Lover's Guide</h2>

        <p>Barcelona's food scene is extraordinary. Here are the experiences you shouldn't miss:</p>

        <h3>Tapas</h3>
        <p>Skip the tourist restaurants on Las Ramblas and head to these neighborhoods for authentic tapas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>El Born</strong> — Try the narrow streets around Passeig del Born for creative tapas bars</li>
            <li><strong>Gracia</strong> — A local neighborhood with excellent tapas at lower prices than the center</li>
            <li><strong>Barceloneta</strong> — The best area for seafood tapas, especially patatas bravas and fried calamari</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Paella</h3>
        <p>Barcelona is coastal, so paella is a must-try. Look for restaurants that cook it fresh to order (it takes about 20 minutes — if it arrives instantly, it was pre-made). The seafood paella along the Barceloneta beachfront restaurants is a classic experience, though locals will tell you the best paella is found further from the tourist spots.</p>

        <h3>Wine and Vermouth</h3>
        <p>Barcelona has a thriving vermouth culture. Join the locals for a pre-lunch "vermut" at traditional bars in the Sant Antoni neighborhood. For wine lovers, the Penedes wine region is just an hour from Barcelona and makes for an excellent day trip.</p>

        <h2>Best Beaches</h2>

        <p>Barcelona's city beaches stretch for over 4 kilometers along the Mediterranean. Here's how they differ:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Barceloneta Beach</strong> — The most famous and most crowded. Great for people-watching but not for tranquility.</li>
            <li><strong>Bogatell Beach</strong> — Less crowded, popular with locals, and has good beach bars (chiringuitos).</li>
            <li><strong>Mar Bella Beach</strong> — The quietest option, favored by local residents. Has a more relaxed vibe.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For truly beautiful beaches, take a day trip to the Costa Brava (about 1-2 hours north). Towns like Tossa de Mar and Cadaques offer crystal-clear water and dramatic coastal scenery.</p>

        <h2>Where to Stay</h2>

        <p>The best neighborhoods for tourists are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Eixample</strong> — Central, well-connected, and home to most of Gaudi's buildings. Great mid-range to luxury options. Average: $130-250/night.</li>
            <li><strong>Gothic Quarter</strong> — Atmospheric and historic, perfect if you want to be in the heart of the action. Average: $100-200/night.</li>
            <li><strong>El Born</strong> — Trendy, walkable, and close to the beach. Some of Barcelona's best boutique hotels. Average: $120-220/night.</li>
            <li><strong>Gracia</strong> — Local feel, excellent restaurants, and lower prices. Average: $80-150/night.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Practical Tips</h2>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Watch out for pickpockets</strong> — Las Ramblas, the metro, and crowded tourist areas are hotspots. Keep valuables in front pockets and stay alert.</li>
            <li><strong>Book attractions early</strong> — Sagrada Familia, Park Guell, and Casa Batllo all require advance tickets. Don't risk disappointment.</li>
            <li><strong>Eat on local time</strong> — Lunch is 2:00-3:30 PM, dinner is 9:00-10:30 PM. Restaurants open earlier for tourists, but the atmosphere is better at local hours.</li>
            <li><strong>Learn basic Catalan</strong> — Barcelona is in Catalonia. While everyone speaks Spanish and most speak English, a "gracies" (thank you in Catalan) is always appreciated.</li>
            <li><strong>Take a day trip</strong> — Montserrat monastery (1 hour) and Girona (40 minutes by high-speed train) are both incredible day trips from Barcelona.</li>
        </ol>
